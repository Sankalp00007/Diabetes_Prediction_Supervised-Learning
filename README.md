# Diabetes_Prediction_Supervised-Learning

📋 Project Overview
DiabetesPredict Pro is a sophisticated web application that leverages machine learning to predict diabetes risk based on patient health parameters. The application uses a Logistic Regression model trained on the Kaggle Diabetes Dataset, achieving 72% accuracy. With a beautiful, modern UI and real-time predictions, it serves as an educational tool for understanding diabetes risk factors and the power of machine learning in healthcare.
